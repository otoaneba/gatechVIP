# Overview
Support vector machine, or SVM, is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification, regression, and outliers detection. This poject uses the SVM algorithm to classify ultrasound images of a right forearm muscle, and maps these images to which finger is being bent. We collected a total of 40 minutes of data of each group members moving each finger successively with a metronome. The 5 minute video file is then converted into 3600 .png images and trained using the `data.txt` file. 


# Collecting Data
[![Data Collection](https://img.youtube.com/vi/F-FhXAFbLvs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-FhXAFbLvs&feature=youtu.be "ultrasound video")

Each group member sat down and collected data 5 minutes per one sitting. A 5 minute video file is converted into 3600 .png image files. Each of these images has a corresponding data entry in the data.txt file that maps and identifies which finger is being bent. 

# Preprossesing
We downsized our images to 28x28 grayscale for faster processing.

These data files maps each .png image with a vector with a value of 99 for each finger being bent. For the purpose of data processing, we've convereted these numbers into binary values of 1s and 0s, and then converted them again to a base-2 binary, so we can distinguish each finger with a unique value.

Each entry in the raw data.txt file will have five numbers, each one representing a finger in a human's hand, in the range [0, 99], which represents how bent the fingers are (0 being unbent, 99 being completely bent). In binary, 0 corresponds to unbent and 1 represents bent. In transforming our data in decimal representation to binary, we set a threshold that separated bent vs. unbent. Currently, we set the threshold as 30, so any number greater than or equal to 30 in the data will be considered as bent.

Example:

Entry that is [99, 0, 0, 0, 0], with 0<sup>th</sup> index corresponding to the thumb,

is converted to [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].

This is then multiplied by [2<sup>4</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>0</sup>]<sup>T</sup> (colunm vector of powers of 2).

This will generate a scalar of 16. This uniquely represents the thumb being bent.

# Training

We split our data sample to 80:20. That is, we split the data to 80% training 20% testing. 

# Model
We used a polynomial based model, with a degree 3 - 9 producing the best accuracy. The confusion matrix shows us the result of our model. The larger our number is on the dark blue diagonal, the better our result. The light blue squares represent our number of misclassification data.
